> The purpose of this lil' engine is:

1) Replace AS3's event model 
2) Replace Flash's "timeline" bullshit with proper states, and 
3) Be fucking amazing


> We wish to accomplish these by a means which is:

1) Lightweight
2) Easy to use
3) Makes me look smart


> For the greater good of:

1) Me
2) Some brunette who's willing to spit out my bastard children
3) Some other third thing



This repository is for ME. I mean, use if want, BUTT understand it's not really worth your trouble. If you want a good engine
for as3 games... try Flixel. Um, fairly sure you know about it if you're here (unless you're 2, 4, or 5 -in which case- get lost,
wtf and, where's biggie and 2pac? (respectively (also nested parenthetics b'cas why naaaaht?)))
